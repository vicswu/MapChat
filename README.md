## A MERN Full-Stack app that allows user to create chatrooms in specific locations on a map and communicate in real time with others.

## Uses Socket.io for the chat feature.

## Improvements to be made in the future:
* Implement Google's Geocode API in order to set room names to the appropriate location's name using latitude and longitude.
* Implement login and signup page to set username.
* Fix some minor issues with socket.close() when users leave the chat room.
* Improve User Experience.
